# TextBasedCaptchaBreaker
Files and data for a text-based captcha breaker. This is version 1 of the project for my DATS 4001 capstone. I will be attempting to create and train a model to read text-based captchas. The model had limited outward applicability, but high accuracy on a subset of the test set. I am currently working on a v2 model that has greater outward applicability with a traditional bounding box recognition method.
